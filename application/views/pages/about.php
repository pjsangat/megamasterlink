                With only four (4) manpower, we started operating as a small shop offering machining and fabrication works.
                However, due to the continuous demand of various electrical services of our clients, our portfolio expanded.
                Additional capital was poured by the management for the acquisition of additional tools and modern equipment,
                expansion of location and addition of manpower to broaden our abilities and to meet the needs of our clients.
                Now, we are the leading electro-mechanical services provider of AC/DC electric motors,
                distribution/power transformers, switchgears and turbine generators.
                <br><br>
                Our clients are known to be the leaders in their respective industry. To name a few, Republic Cement Group,
                Philex Mining, DMCI, Team Energy Philippines, San Miguel Brewery, URC, Light Rail Transit (LRT), Solid Cement
                and Holcim are some of our existing clients to whom we provide our plethora of quality and Class A services.
